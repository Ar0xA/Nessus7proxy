# Nessus7proxy
Very quick and dirty PoC for working around the new Nessus API restrictions. 

TODO's: 
- check status if scan is running, use DOM testing examples from http://www.guguncube.com/2760/python-spynner-test-scripts
- API interface to mimic the old v6 API for programs to access.
- Allow to run headless, without X11
- Re-create other API functions, most importantly: export functionality
